# OMIM

[OMIM](https://omim.org/) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) is a comprehensive database of human genes and genetic phenotypes, with a particular focus on the molecular relationship between genetic variation and phenotypic expression.

Data is downloaded from OMIM's data portal (requires access key): the `morbidmap.txt` file which maps diseases to their associated genes.

## Gene to Disease

Each row in morbidmap represents a disease-gene association with a confidence level (1-4) and an optional susceptibility marker `{}`. These are used to determine the association type and predicate:

| Confidence Level | Susceptibility | Association Type | Predicate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 (molecular basis known) | No | `CausalGeneToDiseaseAssociation` | `biolink:causes` |
| 1 or 2 (mapped gene/phenotype) | No | `CorrelatedGeneToDiseaseAssociation` | `biolink:contributes_to` |
| Any | Yes `{}` | `CorrelatedGeneToDiseaseAssociation` | `biolink:contributes_to` |
| 4 (chromosomal abnormality) | — | Skipped | — |
