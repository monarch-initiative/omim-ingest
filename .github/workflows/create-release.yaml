### This workflow can be run manually from Actions tab in your repository by selecting the "Create Release" workflow.
### When your project is ready for releases, you should:
###   - Uncomment the `schedule` section to run this workflow automatically on a schedule.
###     - As written, this workflow will run every Sunday at midnight UTC.
###   - Remove the `draft: true` line from the `Create Release` step to publish the release immediately.
